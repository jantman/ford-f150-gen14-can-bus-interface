# 2025 Ford F150 Lariat V8 - Wiring and CAN Notes

**Note:** Sorry to any of my currently or historically British friends, but I use the term "Driver side" and "Passenger side" to to refer to left-hand-drive vehicles, as that's what I have and the only service manual that I have. I'm not sure what's different in right-hand-drive vehicles.

## CAN Messages

* Interior ambient lighting: FD-CAN1, HS-CAN3, and LIN.
* Lock system: FD-CAN1, FD-CAN3, HS-CAN3, MS-CAN1

## Audio DSP (C3154A & C3154B) Tee Harness

**TBD**

## CAN Busses, Circuits, and Connectors

The easiest places to access the various busses for testing/experimentation are:

* FD-CAN1, HS-CAN2, MS-CAN1 - C210 and C212 inline connectors behind lower glove box

## Connector Notes

* C210 - Second-from-the-left of the four inline connectors directly behind the glove box. Carries FD-CAN1 and HS-CAN2.
* C211 - Second-from-the-right (or rightmost of the group of 3) of the four inline connectors directly behind the glove box. Does not carry any CAN.
* C212 - Rightmost of the four inline connectors directly behind the glove box; noticeably separated to the right from closely-spaced group of C213/C210/C211. Carries MS-CAN1.
* C213 Leftmost of the four inline connectors directly behind the glove box. Does not carry any CAN.
* C423 - the huge (34-pin) locking black connector for the tailgate and trailer harnesses. Service pigtails are available (WPT-1606 / KU2Z-14S411-SA male and WPT-1607 / KU2Z-14S411-TA female) but very expensive.
* C431 - Early Production variation of C439; this is the 12-pin black "trailer tow connector" under the bed near the tailgate, that's generally plugged into an empty connector with an OBD DLC-like connector on the other side, as a weather cap. This is used for the trailer yaw sensor and trailer camera options, and carries `MS-CAN2` (`VDB27` / `VDB28`). On my vehicle, with the ignition off, this seems to just broadcast `0x227` all the time. The connector is a Molex 33472-6324.
* C439 - Late Production variation of C431; also carries `MS-CAN2`.
* C3154A - Audio DSP Module ("stereo amplifier") on the rear wall of the cab behind the passenger seat, behind the insulation. Carries HS-CAN3. This connector is a Molex 34728-0200 with a combination of 19, 20, and 22 gauge wires. HS-CAN3 High is on pin 1, 22ga Green-Blue wire; HS-CAN3 Low is on pin 11, 22ga White-Green wire. The Molex 34728-0200 is a proprietary connector.
  * C3154B also connects to the Audio DSP Module and in my vehicle (standard 8-speaker B&O stereo) just has four pins populated for ground and power. This is a Molex 34728-0080 with 19ga and possibly one 22ga wires. Pins 1 and 5 are circuit GD348 ground to the C pillar, 19ga Black-Yellow wire; pins 4 and 8 are circuit SBA40 to Fuse 40, always hot, 19ga Red wire.
