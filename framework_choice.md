**My Knowledge Level**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Good)

### 6. Zephyr RTOS

**Description**: Real-time operating system with ESP32 support and strong automotive focus.

**Pros**:
- Professional RTOS with automotive pedigree
- Excellent CAN support
- Strong real-time guarantees
- Good for safety-critical applications
- Native CAN protocol stack

**Cons**:
- Complex setup and configuration
- Steep learning curve
- Limited ESP32-S3 support compared to other platforms
- Overkill for this application

**CAN Support**:
- Excellent native CAN support
- CAN-FD support
- Automotive networking protocols

**My Knowledge Level**: ⭐⭐ (Fair)

## Recommendation

### Primary Recommendation: Arduino Framework with PlatformIO

For this Ford F150 CAN bus interface project, I recommend the **Arduino Framework with PlatformIO** for the following reasons:

1. **Rapid Development**: Your project requires interfacing with known CAN messages from the OpenDBC database - Arduino's rich library ecosystem will accelerate development.

2. **Dual CAN Support**: Well-established libraries exist for both the ESP32's built-in TWAI controller and external MCP2515 controllers.

3. **Automotive Focus**: Many Arduino CAN libraries are specifically designed for automotive applications.

4. **DBC Support**: Libraries like `can-dbc-loader` can parse the Ford Lincoln DBC files you're already using.

5. **OTA Updates**: Critical for deployed automotive applications where physical access may be difficult.

6. **Community Support**: Large community working on similar automotive projects.

### Secondary Recommendation: ESP-IDF

If you need maximum performance, real-time guarantees, or want to minimize memory usage, **ESP-IDF** would be the second choice. It's more complex but offers complete control over the hardware.

## Sample Project Structure

```
src/
├── main.cpp (or main.c for ESP-IDF)
├── can_manager.h/cpp
├── message_handlers.h/cpp
├── gpio_controller.h/cpp
├── config.h
└── dbc/
    └── ford_lincoln_base_pt.dbc
lib/
├── ESP32CAN/
├── MCP2515/
└── DBC_Parser/
```

## Next Steps

1. Set up PlatformIO project with ESP32-S3 target
2. Configure dual CAN bus libraries
3. Implement DBC message parsing
4. Create modular handlers for bed lights and toolbox control
5. Add OTA update capability
6. Implement comprehensive error handling and diagnostics

This approach will give us the best balance of development speed, maintainability, and functionality for your specific automotive CAN bus interface requirements.
