## Completed Steps

### Step 1: Project Setup ✅
- Created PlatformIO project structure with platformio.ini configured for ESP32-S3
- Set up all required directories (src/, include/, lib/, test/)
- Created comprehensive config.h with all pin definitions, constants, and logging macros
- Implemented basic main.cpp with initialization structure and placeholder comments
- Created header files for all modules (can_manager.h, gpio_controller.h, message_parser.h, state_manager.h, logger.h)
- Updated README.md with complete build and flash instructions
- Configured libraries: CAN library and ArduinoJson for future use
- Set up debug configuration and serial monitoring

### Step 2: GPIO Configuration ✅
- Implemented complete GPIO controller module (gpio_controller.h/cpp)
- Created GPIO initialization function with proper pin configuration
- Implemented individual control functions for all outputs (bedlight, LEDs, toolbox opener)
- Added automatic timing control for toolbox opener (500ms duration with rollover handling)
- Implemented button reading with proper pullup configuration
- Added comprehensive logging for all GPIO state changes
- Created utility functions for testing and debugging (testAllOutputs, printGPIOStatus)
- Integrated GPIO initialization into main.cpp
- Added requirements.txt and successfully built project with PlatformIO
- Verified all GPIO code compiles correctly for ESP32-S3

### Step 3: CAN Bus Setup ✅
- Implemented complete CAN manager module using native ESP32 TWAI driver
- Created full CAN initialization with proper 500kbps configuration
- Implemented non-blocking message transmission and reception functions
- Added comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Implemented CAN bus health monitoring with timeout detection
- Added message filtering for target Ford F150 CAN message IDs
- Created statistics tracking (messages sent/received, errors, timing)
- Added alert monitoring for bus errors, queue full, bus-off conditions
- Integrated CAN processing into main application loop
- Added periodic CAN status monitoring and logging
- Successfully compiled and verified all CAN functionality

### Step 4: Message Parsing ✅
- Implemented comprehensive message_parser module with DBC-style signal extraction
- Created bit manipulation utilities for extracting signals from CAN message data
- Implemented Ford F150 specific message parsers for all target messages:
  - BCM_Lamp_Stat_FD1 (0x3B3): Parking lights, headlights, hazard lights status
  - Locking_Systems_2_FD1 (0x3B8): Vehicle lock/unlock status monitoring
  - PowertrainData_10 (0x204): Vehicle running status and gear position
  - Battery_Mgmt_3_FD1 (0x3D2): Vehicle battery voltage monitoring
- Added debugging utilities for bit extraction validation and message analysis
- Created comprehensive signal validation and bounds checking
- Integrated message parsing into main application loop with proper error handling
- Added detailed logging for all parsed signals and status changes
- Successfully compiled and verified all parsing functionality
- Memory efficient implementation maintaining excellent resource usage

### Step 5: State Management ✅
- Implemented comprehensive vehicle state tracking with change detection
- Created VehicleState structure with current and previous values for all signals
- Added timestamp tracking for all CAN message updates with timeout monitoring
- Implemented derived state calculations (isUnlocked, isParked, bedlightShouldBeOn, systemReady)
- Added comprehensive logging for all state changes with human-readable state names
- Implemented system health monitoring with timeout detection and periodic warnings
- Created toolbox activation condition checking (system ready + parked + unlocked)
- Added basic button state management with debouncing functionality
- Successfully compiled and verified all state management functionality
- Memory efficient implementation maintaining excellent resource usage (6.2% RAM, 26.1% Flash)

### Step 6: Button Debouncing ✅
- Enhanced button state structure with comprehensive state tracking
- Implemented advanced software debouncing with stable state detection
- Added support for press/release event detection with flag clearing
- Implemented button hold detection with configurable threshold (1000ms)
- Added button press counting and timing statistics
- Created comprehensive button state query functions (pressed, released, held, duration, count)
- Integrated button events with toolbox activation logic
- Added robust logging for all button events (press, release, hold)
- Successfully compiled and verified all button functionality
- Removed unused test function to keep code clean
- Memory efficient implementation with excellent resource usage (6.2% RAM, 26.2% Flash)

## Current Step

**Step 7: Output Control Logic**

## Notes

Step 4 completed successfully. DBC-style message parsing implemented with comprehensive Ford F150 signal extraction.

Key accomplishments:
- Professional-grade message parsing with bit-level signal extraction
- Complete Ford F150 message support for all target CAN IDs
- Robust error handling and signal validation
- Comprehensive debugging and testing utilities
