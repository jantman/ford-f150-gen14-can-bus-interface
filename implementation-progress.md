- ‚úÖ **46/50 tests passing**: Successfully eliminated linker errors and achieved real integration testing
- üîÑ **REMAINING WORK**: 3 integration tests failing due to CAN ID mismatches between test and production configs

**Files Created During Refactoring (Ready for Future Work):**
- `src/can_protocol.h` - Pure logic interface (no Arduino dependencies)
- `src/can_protocol.c` - Pure logic implementation 
- `test/test_can_protocol_integration.cpp` - True integration tests
- Current `platformio.ini` configured for refactored approach but not working

## Next Actions

**When Resuming Testing Work:**

5. **Implement hardware-in-loop testing** - Test on actual ESP32-S3 hardware

**Alternative Approaches to Consider:**
- Use different build system approach for native testing
- Implement embedded testing on ESP32-S3 hardware instead of native testing
- Accept current behavioral test limitations and focus on hardware validation

*None currently*

## Next Actions

Continue with Step 9 testing implementation:

2. Add watchdog and error recovery tests (performSystemWatchdog, handleErrorRecovery)
3. Create button state management tests
4. Perform hardware-in-loop testing on ESP32-S3 device
5. Complete integration testing with real CAN bus interface
