## Completed Steps

### Step 1: Project Setup ✅
- Created PlatformIO project structure with platformio.ini configured for ESP32-S3
- Set up all required directories (src/, include/, lib/, test/)
- Created comprehensive config.h with all pin definitions, constants, and logging macros
- Implemented basic main.cpp with initialization structure and placeholder comments
- Created header files for all modules (can_manager.h, gpio_controller.h, message_parser.h, state_manager.h, logger.h)
- Updated README.md with complete build and flash instructions
- Configured libraries: CAN library and ArduinoJson for future use
- Set up debug configuration and serial monitoring

## Current Step

**Step 2: GPIO Configuration**

## Notes

Step 1 completed successfully. All project structure and configuration files created.

## Issues/Blockers

*None currently*

## Next Actions

Ready to proceed to Step 2: GPIO Configuration upon human confirmation.
