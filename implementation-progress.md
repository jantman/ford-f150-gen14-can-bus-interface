## Completed Steps

### Step 1: Project Setup ✅
- Created PlatformIO project structure with platformio.ini configured for ESP32-S3
- Set up all required directories (src/, include/, lib/, test/)
- Created comprehensive config.h with all pin definitions, constants, and logging macros
- Implemented basic main.cpp with initialization structure and placeholder comments
- Created header files for all modules (can_manager.h, gpio_controller.h, message_parser.h, state_manager.h, logger.h)
- Updated README.md with complete build and flash instructions
- Configured libraries: CAN library and ArduinoJson for future use
- Set up debug configuration and serial monitoring

### Step 2: GPIO Configuration ✅
- Implemented complete GPIO controller module (gpio_controller.h/cpp)
- Created GPIO initialization function with proper pin configuration
- Implemented individual control functions for all outputs (bedlight, LEDs, toolbox opener)
- Added automatic timing control for toolbox opener (500ms duration with rollover handling)
- Implemented button reading with proper pullup configuration
- Added comprehensive logging for all GPIO state changes
- Created utility functions for testing and debugging (testAllOutputs, printGPIOStatus)
- Integrated GPIO initialization into main.cpp
- Added requirements.txt and successfully built project with PlatformIO
- Verified all GPIO code compiles correctly for ESP32-S3

## Current Step

**Step 3: CAN Bus Setup**

## Notes

Step 2 completed successfully. All GPIO functionality implemented and tested via compilation.

Key accomplishments:
- Full GPIO controller module with state tracking
- Smart toolbox opener timing with overflow protection  
- Comprehensive logging for all GPIO operations
- Modular design for easy testing and debugging
- Successfully resolved PlatformIO build issues

## Issues/Blockers

CAN library compatibility issue resolved by removing problematic library dependency. Will implement native ESP32 TWAI driver in Step 3.

## Next Actions

Ready to proceed to Step 3: CAN Bus Setup using native ESP32 TWAI driver upon human confirmation.
